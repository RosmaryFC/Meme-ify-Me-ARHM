There is code duplication! Your job, if you choose to accept it, is:

1. deduplicate:

    a)  - VanillaMemeEdit.decodePhoto()
        - DemotivationalMemeEdit.decodePhoto()

    b)  - VanillaMemeEdit.onShareClick()
        - DemotivationalMemeEdit.onShareClick()

    c)  - VanillaMemeEdit.saveVanillaMeme()
        - DemotivationalMemeEdit.saveDemotivationalMeme()

What you can do is relocate the similar methods above into `MainActivity.java` or into a special `Helpers.java` file.
Example:

    // don't use this line
    Bitmap bmp = decodePhoto(this, imagePath);

    // instead choose one of the following:
    // Bitmap bmp = Helpers.decodePhoto(this, imagePath);    // 1
    // Bitmap bmp = MainActivity.decodePhoto(this, imagePath);    // 2

2. add more logging for actions that are taken but don't have a corresponding log message

Example:
    - when text activities are filled out
    - when some of the buttons are clicked, like when texts are being previewed

3. Verify that `IAdobeAuthClientCredentials` and `IAviaryClientCredentials` are being used. If not, remove their implementations. Easy way to figure out is to ask the team members about it.

4. Add `Meme from Template` feature to Rosmary's app.


When in doubt, ask the team members or @ehtesh in the #general slack channel.
